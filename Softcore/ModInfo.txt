Softcore prevents your character from being deleted when you die.
If you select "Retry" on the death screen, you will wake up on the ship without losing anything.
If you select "Main Menu" on the death screen, you will be returned to the main menu as usual, but your save file will still be available.
Either way, you will respawn with only one health point.
